# chromeKeePassXC
Chrome extension for [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) with Native Messaging.

This is a heavily forked version of [pfn](https://github.com/pfn)'s [chromeIPass](https://github.com/pfn/passifox).

## Protocol

Transmitting messages between KeePassXC and chromeKeePassXC is totally rewritten. This is still under development.
Now the requests are encrypted by [TweetNaCl.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js) box method and does the following:

1. chromeKeePassXC generates a key pair (with public and secret key) and transfers the public key to KeePassXC
2. When KeePassXC receives the public key it generates its own key pair and transfers the public key to chromeKeePassXC
3. All messages (excluding get-databasehash) are now encrypted.
4. When chromeKeePassXC sends a message it is encrypted with KeePassXC's public key, a random generated nonce and chromeKeePassXC's secret key.
5. When KeePassXC sends a message it is encrypted with chromeKeePassXC's public key etc.
6. Databases are stored based on the current public key used with `associate`. A new key pair for data transfer is generated each time chromeKeePassXC is launched.

Encrypted messages are built with these JSON parameters:
- action - `test-associate`, `associate`, `get-logins`, `get-logins-count`, `set-login`...
- message - Encrypted message, base64 encoded
- nonce - 24 bytes long random data, base64 encoded. This must be the same when responding to a request.
